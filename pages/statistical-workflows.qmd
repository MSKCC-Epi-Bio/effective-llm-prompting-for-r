## Overview

This page focuses on how AI can enhance traditional statistical workflows in R, improving efficiency and providing new insights.

## Featured Workflows

### Automated Exploratory Data Analysis

Use AI to generate comprehensive EDA reports with minimal code.

```r
# Using DataExplorer package
library(DataExplorer)

# Generate comprehensive report
create_report(iris)

# Alternatively, using AI-based summaries
# Function to generate AI insights from basic EDA
ai_data_insights <- function(data, description = NULL) {
  # Generate basic summaries
  summary_stats <- summary(data)
  correlations <- cor(data[sapply(data, is.numeric)], use = "complete.obs")

  # Create a text prompt for the AI
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Based on this dataset",
    if (!is.null(description)) paste0(" about ", description) else "",
    ", here are the summary statistics:\n\n",
    capture.output(summary_stats),
    "\n\nAnd correlation matrix:\n\n",
    capture.output(correlations),
    "\n\nProvide 3-5 key insights about this data and suggest potential analyses."
  )

  # Call your preferred AI service here
  # (use one of the methods from the AI Tools page)
  return(prompt) # Replace with actual AI call
}
```

### Automated Feature Engineering

Enhance model performance with AI-suggested feature transformations.

```r
# Using recipes package with AI enhancement
library(recipes)
library(tidymodels)

# Standard feature engineering
rec <- recipe(target ~ ., data = training_data) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())

# AI-enhanced features would extend this approach
# by suggesting optimal transformations based on data patterns
```

### Hybrid Models: Statistical + Machine Learning

Combine traditional statistical methods with ML for interpretable yet powerful models.

```r
# Example: Augmented regression approach
library(tidymodels)
library(mgcv)

# Fit a GAM model
gam_fit <- gam(y ~ s(x1) + s(x2) + x3, data = training_data)

# Use predictions as features in a second-level model
training_data$gam_pred <- predict(gam_fit)

# Add ML model that can capture additional patterns
final_model <- rand_forest(trees = 500) %>%
  set_engine("ranger") %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  fit(y ~ . + gam_pred, data = training_data)
```
